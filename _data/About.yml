      Howdy! I'm Joe, a lifetime student of technical, obscure, and interesting subjects. I'm a full stack developer with a deep passion for Javascript, React, and all things styling.
      I build vibrant, engaging, and accessible web applications for anyone and everyone, with a special interest in EdTech, AI/Machine Learning, and Web Design. 
      
      I have a jack-of-all trades background from studying blacksmithing and genetics in my undergrad to managing a team of emergency maintence technitians for Colorado ski resorts.
      I bring an analytical, creative approach to everything I do, leveraging my unique experiences to solve problems in innovative ways.
      When I'm not at my computer I spend my time rock and ice climbing, thru-hiking, and playing DnD (I learned on 1st edition!)
