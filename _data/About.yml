    description: I have spent much of my life immersed in travel and adventure, taking on odd jobs along the way. From managing a team of emergency maintenance technitians for ski resorts to studying genetics and blacksmithing, I've never wanted to reflect on my life and have any "what ifs". This path has led to countless enriching experiences, but it also brought me to careers where I would quickly hit a plateau. Throughout it all, one constant has been my passion for creative problem solving, learning new skills, and being facinated by the concept of microscopic, imperceptable things can create real world impacts. Distilling this constant into what is most important to me, I discovered a passion for software engineering as it perfectly combines all of the elements from my past; the complexities of genetic code, the challenge of puzzles, and artistic expression. My goal is to find a career that continually challenges me to grow with my work, and the opportunity to collaborate with intelligent, driven individuals.
